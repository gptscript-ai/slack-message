# slack-message

This is a simple GPTScript tool to send a Slack message to a channel.

## Setup and Usage

1. Create a new Slack app in your workspace.
2. Under the OAuth & Permissions settings, give your app the following User Token scopes:
   - `channels:read`
   - `chat:write`
3. Install the app to your workspace.
4. Get your User OAuth Token from the app's OAuth & Permissions settings.
5. Set the token to the environment variable `GPTSCRIPT_SLACK_TOKEN`.
6. Now you can use the tool in a script:

```
Tools: github.com/gptscript-ai/slack-message

Send a message to the general channel saying "hello from gptscript".
```
